# Light_Pollution_and_Shearwater_nest_attendance
Repository containing script and data for the studying the effects of light pollution from industrial ships on adult shearwater nest attendance.

A study on how the light pollution from ships anchoring in front of a shearwater colony affects nest attendance. The study and script covers all steps of data cleaning and analysis which lead to final results. It combines three data sources: 
Shearwater registrations at a cavernous colony entrance using a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system 
Ambient light levels at the colony measured continuously by a light meter logger
Ship AIS location data purchased from MarineTraffic

The study and data collected covers four breeding seasons: 2017 to 2020.
